ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [ScrapePilot.com](https://scrapepilot.com) adding more features to it
   
ðŸš€ Some of my main projects:

â€¢ [ScrapePilot](https://scrapepilot.com) - It is basically an email scraping software that scrapes emails from any webpage/website/URL/Directory you provide to it. It has reviews/linkedIn scraping features as well

â€¢ [Office addins for Flow Fact](https://www.flowfact.de) - a CRM software. I worked on their addins UI using [reactJs](react.com). It is built using aws lambda, react, typescript, nodejs, aws cognito and exchange server.

â€¢ [Office addin for patentbots](https://www.patentbots.com) - provides essential tools for patent prosecution. I contributed to it. It is built using vanilla javascript, django, GCP, aws.
